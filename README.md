  DESCRIPTION : <br />
    POST a job to the server to perform migration. The chunk size is in seconds which sets how much data must be moved in each iteration. If the job submission is successful a guid is generated which can be used to keep track of the job.

  The `dbConfig` parameter should contain [Influx connection information](https://node-influx.github.io/typedef/index.html#static-typedef-ISingleHostConfig), for feeding into the Node-Influx client
